# EEG Classification Model

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook for the EEG Classification Model project, focused on analyzing and classifying EEG data. This project involves a comprehensive approach to preprocessing EEG data, feature extraction, and applying machine learning algorithms to classify different mental states or conditions based on the EEG signals.

## Project Overview

The EEG Classification Model project aims to develop a robust pipeline for classifying EEG data. The main steps include data cleaning, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation. By utilizing advanced machine learning techniques, we aim to accurately classify the mental states represented in the EEG data.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a critical step in the EEG classification pipeline. The following steps were performed to clean and prepare the data for analysis:

- **Handling Missing Values**: Identified and handled missing values to ensure the dataset's integrity.
- **Noise Reduction**: Applied filtering techniques to reduce noise and artifacts in the EEG signals.
- **Normalization**: Standardized the EEG data to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.

## Feature Extraction

Feature extraction involves selecting and transforming raw EEG data into meaningful features that can be used for classification:

- **Time-Domain Features**: Extracted statistical measures such as mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis from the EEG signals.
- **Frequency-Domain Features**: Applied Fourier Transform to extract frequency components and power spectral density features.
- **Wavelet Transform**: Used wavelet decomposition to capture both time and frequency information from the EEG signals.

## Machine Learning Models

Several machine learning models were trained and evaluated to classify the EEG data:

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Utilized SVM with different kernels to classify the EEG features.
- **Random Forest**: Applied Random Forest classifier for robust classification and feature importance analysis.
- **Neural Networks**: Implemented deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for automatic feature extraction and classification.

## Model Evaluation

The performance of the models was evaluated using various metrics:

- **Accuracy**: Measured the overall correctness of the model predictions.
- **Precision, Recall, and F1-Score**: Evaluated the model's ability to correctly identify each class.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Analyzed the detailed classification performance and identified misclassification patterns.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for the project.
- **Libraries**: 
  - **NumPy**: For numerical operations and data manipulation.
  - **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - **SciPy**: For signal processing and feature extraction.
  - **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning model implementation and evaluation.
  - **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training deep learning models.
  - **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization and plotting.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to EEG data classification, combining advanced preprocessing techniques, feature extraction methods, and machine learning algorithms.
